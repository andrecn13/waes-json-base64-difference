# WAES Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to show your coding skills and what you value in software engineering. We value new ideas so next to the original requirement feel free to improve/add/extend.
We evaluate the assignment depending on your role (Developer/Tester) and your level of seniority.

# The assignment

- Provide 2 http endpoints that accepts JSON base64 encoded binary data on both endpoints
  - <host>/v1/diff/<ID>/left and <host>/v1/diff/<ID>/right
- The provided data needs to be diff-ed and the results shall be available on a third end
  point
  - <host>/v1/diff/<ID>
- The results shall provide the following info in JSON format
  - If equal return that
  - If not of equal size just return that
  - If of same size provide insight in where the diffs are, actual diffs are not needed.
    - So mainly offsets + length in the data
- Make assumptions in the implementation explicit, choices are good but need to be
  communicated
